# Graduation Project Repository

This repository contains all source code and documentation for my university graduation project. The project is a comprehensive library management system, including:

- **Web Server Software**: Built with Node.js, providing a user interface and API for library operations.
- **Raspberry Pi Firmware**: Controls hardware devices and communicates with the web server.
- **ESP32 Firmware**: Manages sensors and peripherals, enabling IoT features for the library system.

## Structure

- `/web-server/` - Node.js web server source code
- `/raspberry-pi/` - Raspberry Pi firmware and scripts
- `/esp32/` - ESP32 firmware source code

## Features
